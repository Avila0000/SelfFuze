        <h3>I'm Shanaka, and I was born in Beeville, TX.
            From a young age, I knew I wanted to be of service to people and aid them in life transitions. I graduated from Texas Christian University with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in 2012 and from Capella University with a Master of Science in Nursing in 2018.  I am currently pursuing a Doctor of Nursing Practice with specialization as a Nurse Practitioner from Texas Wesleyan University. I am very passionate about holistic medicine and believe the power of herbs with knowledge aids us in limitless opportunities to heal ourselves. I think we're self-healers. We need self-awareness, guidance, and the ability to tap into our power.
            I began my nursing career in 2012 and started a travel nursing career in 2014. My nursing career has prepped me to work with diverse populations and has strengthened my empathy and conflict resolution capacity.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            I have been featured in Who's Who Among American High school students, The National Dean's list, and the President's list at Capella University. In addition, I have several certificates, including Plant-Based Nutrition from Cornell University and Empathic Life Coach from Investing in Souls, Heart & Empires.
            Through adversities, battling bouts of depression, anxiety, and spiritual awakenings, I have walked into my gifts. My years of experience in therapy and searching for answers to how to be my best self aided me in this journey of living authentically. I am excited to help other people start their personal journey and coach them through life's progressions. The evolution of self is by far the most crucial path anyone can embark on and is a journey that requires support. I hope my clients tap into their divine power while learning stress resilience and balancing self-care.  I also hope my clients will gain access to their full potential while pursuing an authentic life for themselves.

            I am also a poet that has been featured several times at The Library Caf√© in DFW.  I wrote Writing My Heart Back Together, published in 2017, and was featured in several other books.
            I enjoy spending time with family, learning, teaching, evolving, and growing. Some of my hobbies include learning reading, traveling outside of the United States, pole & aerial dance, taking care of my pet kids, and enjoying fantastic food.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            I look forward to connecting with you.
            Thank you,
            Shanaka Martin
